# Vase

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
### User stories

As an e-shop owner:
- I want to easily add, edit and delete products through the site.
- I want to show products rating, so I can build trust and confidence among my customers.
- I want to send newsletters, so I encourage customers to come back.
- I want to offer informative description about each product, so that customer knows what he/she is buying.

As a customer:
- I want clear menu, so I can easily navigate though the site.
- I want to see list of products, so I can select what I want to purchase.
- I want to view my bag, so I can icrease or decrease quantity, delete product if I changed my mind and see summary of what am I purchasing.
- I want to see total order, so I can see how much I'm going to pay.
- I want to get newsletter of newest products and special offers.
